Iturnedmy head away
Didn'twannahear what you said
You hadchangedyour mind
Ishowedup insecure
But Ithoughtyouwouldbe sure
IguessI had a lost sight

[Chorus:]
But at the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
See I wentafteryou like I should
I wentafterwhat I wanted
I wentafterwhat I wanted
And Ineverreally got it
But it don'tmatterat all

Iguessit was a lot
To ask forthesethings we'd lost
Iguessit was just a dream
And timechangesmany things
But myheartitstillsings
For you, I don't know why

[Chorus:]
But at the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
See I wentafteryou like I should
I wentafterwhat I wanted
I wentafterwhat I wanted
And Ineverreally got it
But it don'tmatterat all

[Bridge:]
IthoughtI'dspendmy last days 
Holding your hand
Now how am I,sincehe'slyingdead on the floor

[Chorus:]
But at the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
And I'll know that my life was good
At the end of my life
I'll look back on my life
See I wentafteryou like I should
I wentafterwhat I wanted
I wentafterwhat I wanted
And Ineverreally got it
But it don'tmatterat all

Everything else I lost it
I wentafterwhat I wanted
I wentafterwhat I wanted
And the rest don'treallymatter
It don'tmatterat all

It's been a long time coming, coming, coming
Feeling yourpresencehovering, hovering, hovering
Time that Ifinallysay something, something, something
You're notgonnatake this one lie down

But the cold hardtruthis I can make itwithoutyou
And the cold hardtruthI've been waiting, I'm waiting
And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we weremeantto be alone, alone, alone
We weremeantto be alone, alone,layinglow

It's been a long time honey, honey, honey
You shouldn't laugh, it's not funny, funny, funny
After I'm done I feel nothing, nothing, nothing
Although I feel naked, certain, certain, babe

And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we weremeantto be alone, alone, alone
We weremeantto be alone

But the cold hardtruthis I can make itwithoutyou
And the cold hardtruthis I'vewaitedtoo long
And the cold hardtruthis I can make itwithoutyou
And the cold hardtruthis I'vewaitedforever

And as I fly away, you fly your life away
'Cause you and I were meant, we were meant
But the cold hardtruthis I can make itwithoutyou
And the cold hardtruthis I'vewaitedforever
And the cold hardtruthis I can make itwithoutyou
And the cold hardtruthis we weremeantto be alone
We weremeantto be alone,alonelaying low
We weremeantto be alone, alone, alone
We weremeantto be alone, alone,layinglow

The day isgettinglate
It’s a lot to take
Looking at your face
Ithidesnothing
Emotions are recycled
I open the window
I don’t knowaboutyou
But I’mfeelingstifled

Then I get just a glimpse
I seewhereour love is
Please look into my eyes
Baby yougottatry to

Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Don’t talk in circles

You don’t know what to say
How did we get this way
It’s like we justpressplay
And run onautomatic(it gets so static)
I canbarelybreathe
You’refillingup with steam
You say it’saboutme
But I’m justsettingboundaries

Then I see abrightlight
I see it’sworththe fight
I know we’ll get it right
Baby our love canshineif you

Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Dial into me
Don’t walk in circles

We’reafterthe same things
Bursting at the same seams
Icannotcarry thewholeload here
No I can’t tell you what that means
I’mgonnacarry my load
If youpromisenot to take your eyes off me
Don’t take your eyes off me
Don’t take your eyes off me
Let'sbreakthe circle

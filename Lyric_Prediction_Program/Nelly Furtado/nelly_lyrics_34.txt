Me andSuziehad so much fun

Had an old goldChevyand aplaceof my own
But thebiggestkick I ever got

While theotherkids wereRockingRound the Clock
We werehoppingandboppingto theCrocodileRock

When your feet just can't keep still
Ineverknew me abettertime and IguessIneverwill
OhLawdymamathoseFriday nights
WhenSuziewore herdressestight
And theCrocodileRocking was out of sight

Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala

But theyearswent by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for someforeignguy
Longnightscrying by therecordmachine
Dreaming of myChevyand my old blue jeans
But they'llneverkill thethrillswe've got
Burning up to theCrocodileRock
Learning fast as theweekswent past
Wereallythought theCrocodileRockwouldlast

Tim took you fromghettoto class, how to hold your glass
To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash
People was seein' you pass, likerightthrough the drapes
Ibroughtyou the private,ouncewit the gates

Thinkin' thatstuffmake me faint, justwhistlereal fast
Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag
Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It costeveryminute, and you know I'm on tour

And I'mdeeplycommitted,althoughI'm forgettin'
Sometimeswhilehittin' it ,differentnameswould slip
If I been wit a chick,checkme miss
Yourcomplexionswitched,honeyyou been on trips

But you don'tappreciatethis, till your back in the Jetta
Noicebergyou own, just Angelica's sweaters
If thesteaksain't T-Bone, you ain'tproperlyfed
Huntonightis bet burgers, nocheeseon the bread
And I say

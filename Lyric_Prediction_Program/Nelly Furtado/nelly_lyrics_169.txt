Listen, I got youphobicoffa this like arachnids
Drastic, it ain't plastic, it's just pro blackness
Grown mantacticsno pediatrics
The kind oftrackthat make thecomebackmiraculous
The catalyst.Thoughtwith theknackof splashin'
I'm dashin', Imasteredthecraftof mashin'
The level-headedthoroughbredthefemalespassion
Magneticattractionbekeepingem askin'

Thecrewsin the Cadillac, the Pendergrassin'
Swerve half-naked won't come near crashin'
But if I go toHeavenwould ya'll know my name
Orwouldit be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?
Clap for yourfreedomdog, that's what's happenin'
My spit takecriticalpolitical action
Thehustleis a puzzle, eachpieceis a fraction
Andeveryword that'sunderstoodis a transaction

You need aheartthat'sfilledwith music
If you use it you can fly
Listen,
If you want to be high

Yo kick off ya shoes, jump off the jock

No time tolollygagorloungewith scallywags
Gimme the disc or I'll put itwhereyour body at
Oldschoolspit flow laid overTrottertracks
With no apology,fraudor tricknology
Justtrustwhat I see and I say andfollowme
My way, I be the open book, lookinsideme

Oh, it's in your eyes
I can see the weakness
You don't have to hide
I can take you under
Under my wing
Cause yourvoicegives me a song
That I love to sing

Only to tear you down
Don't give up

Oh, it's good for nothing

You were just a child
Ready to explore
Andeverythingyou saw
Looked like an open door

Aplaceyou can remember
You'd love to go back
But you can't even comprehend
That it's all in the past

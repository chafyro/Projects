Oh it's sobeautifulout and I can't see why we're notallowedto be
Up in the sky with thebirdscounting the flowers
Oh mypowershavefailedmeagainwhen I can't seebeginningto end
No I try and test itagainthrough the hours

Oh why can't I begreenas thegrassbeneath my feet
Asfreshas the dew hits thegroundin the morning
And notyellowlikebumblebees,pleasetake me off my knees, my knees
I don'twannabe red forever

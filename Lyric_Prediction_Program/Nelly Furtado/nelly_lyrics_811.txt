Paint my face in your magazines
Make it lookwhiterthan it seems
Paint me over with your dreams
Shove away my ethnicity
Burneverynotion that I
May have aflameinside to fight
And say just what is on my mind
Withoutoffendingyour might

'Cause this life is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless
What are yougonnado?

So say what you want
Say what you want

I saw her faceoutsidetoday
Weatherworn, lookin' all the rage
Took herpassionand her gaze
And made a poster
Now it'smoccasinswe sport
We take thecultureand contort
Perhaps only to distort
What we are hidin'

'Cause this life is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless
What are yougonnado?

But say what you want
Say what you want
Say, say

Hey you, the one, the one outside
Are yougonnaget in, get in?
Hey you, the one that don't fit in
How you, how yougonnaget in?
Hey you, the one outside
Are you evergonnaget in with your
Broken teeth,brokenjaw,brokenmojo?

Yeah, this life is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless
What are yougonnado?

'Cause this life is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless
What are yougonnado?
'Cause this life is too short
To live it just for you
But when you feel so powerless
What are yougonnado?

Say what you want (life is too short)
Say what you want
Say what you want (just for you)
Say what you want
Say what you want (feel powerless)
Say what you want
Say, say, say, say, yeah (gonna do)

(Life is too short)
(Just for you)
(Feel powerless)
(Gonna do)

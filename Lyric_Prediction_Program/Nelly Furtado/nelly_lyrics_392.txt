You'restandingat the door
I'mfallingto the floor
You look evenbetterthan you did before
I'mstaringat my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been a while, but I couldn'tforgetyou

[Bridge]
Just alittlelook has got mefeelingthings
Just alittletouch has got meseeingthings
Just alittletaste has got me off the chains
Doingthingsthat I don't want to

[Chorus]
Do it like you do it to me (I'mburningup)
Do it like you do it to me (It's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me; just open up
Don't you know how much I want you?

We'resittingreal close, and I can feel your breath
Iwannatouch your hand, but I lay back
'Cause you know thisthingcouldspiralin the night
I'vechangedmy mind; I'mreadyfor you this time

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

We'resittingreal close; I can feel your breath
Iwannatouch your hand, but I lay back
We'resittingreal close; I can feel your breath
Iwannatouch your hand; Icannotfight it off

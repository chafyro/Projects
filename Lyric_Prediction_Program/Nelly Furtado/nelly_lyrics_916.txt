You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'llneverever fade
You'relovelybut it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
Andthoughmy love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't knowwheremy soul is, I don't knowwheremy home is 
(And baby all I need for you to know is)
I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't knowwheremy soul is, I don't knowwheremy home is
All I need for you to know is

Yourfaithin mebringsme to tears
Evenafteralltheseyears
And itpainsme so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
Andthoughmy love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't knowwheremy soul is, I don't knowwheremy home is 
(And baby all I need for you to know is)
I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't knowwheremy soul is, I don't knowwheremy home is
All I need for you to know is

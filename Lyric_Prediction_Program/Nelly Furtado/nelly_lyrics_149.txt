Oh, ooh, oh

Youlikedme 'til youheardmy shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain'tgoingsolo
Youlikedme 'til youheardmy shit on the radio
But now I'm just toomainstreamfor you, oh no
Youlikedme 'til you seen me on your t.v.
Well if you're so lowbelowthen why you watching
You say goodthingscome tothosewho wait
I've beenwaitinga long time for it

Irememberthe days when I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less then I was just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Andstillyoucursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

You say yourquestis tobringit higher
Well Ineverseenchangewithout a fire
But from yourmouthI have seen a lot of burning
ButunderneathIthinkit's a lot of yearning
Your face, thecolorschange fromgreento yellow
To thepointwhere you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'dexpectfrom me, like that's what I'm about

Irememberthe days when I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less then I was just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Andstillyoucursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

It's so mucheasierto stay downthereguaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up hereexposingmyselftryingtobreakthrough
Than to burn in the spotlight, open fire, turn in the spitfire, open fire
Screamwithoutmaking a sound, open fire, be up herewithoutlooking down, open fire
Ohafraidof heights

Irememberthe days when I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less then I was just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Andstillyoucursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

Myself, myself
Myself, myself
Now you'refeelingme, and now you'refeelingme
Myself, myself
Now you'refeelingme, now you'refeelingme now
Why ya hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me so so,
Myself, myself
Leave me down down down down lowleaveme
Myself, myself
Down da down down da down da down down down

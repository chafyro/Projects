HotmotelStuffy inside
I know well
Thiselevenwalls
Hotblacktar
I tan my legs
Rest myheartAnddreamof the city

Magazine and diet coke
I'm not a joke
This is me
Damaged leg
Heavy cart
Plastic cups
Linen mart

Rock garden
Where I used to play
People stare
Part oftheirday
Coffee break
Lunch at noon
Pumpernickel steak
Green andorangeroom

Done my list
I Make my way
To help my mother
End her day 
Fresh cut grass
Parking lot
We roll on out
We got a lot

We're on our way
Roll thewindowsdown 
Andscreamout loud
We'retirednow

Take it home
Stop on the way
To the bakery
For somefruitand cake
Home I lay
After ashowerclean
I hit my head
And I dream

With alighterand some hairspray
Smoking in the girls' room
Notworsethan Shelley's rapebehindthe McDonald's
By a man shethoughtwas fine, didn't tell anybody
Ormaybeback then we justthoughtthat she wasgettingsome

Now we look back and see that she didn't know how
Weneverthought that we'd getcaughtup
Stuck in theteenagewaste

Rollingaroundin them to see if youwouldget prickled
Slip the acid on yourtonguerooftop mall parkade
We couldn't get enough

You fake, you fake, you fake, you fake
You smoke, you toke, you want, you flaunt, you hit it and you're in it and it's spinning

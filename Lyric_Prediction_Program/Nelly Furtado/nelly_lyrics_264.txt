Let me hold you
For the last time
It's the lastchanceto feel again
But youbrokeme
Now I can't feel anything

When I love you,
It's so untrue
I can't evenconvincemyself
When I'm speaking,
It's thevoiceofsomeoneelse

Whoa ittearsme up
I try to hold on, but ithurtstoo much
I try to forgive, but it's notenoughto make it all okay

You can't play onbrokenstrings
You can't feelanythingthat yourheartdon't want to feel
I can't tell yousomethingthat ain't real

Oh thetruthhurts
And lies worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you alittleless than before

Oh what are we doing
We areturninginto dust
Playinghousein theruinsof us

Running backthroughthe fire
When there'snothingleft to save
It's likechasingthe very lasttrainwhen it's too late (too late)

Oh ittearsme up
I try to hold on, but ithurtstoo much
I try to forgive, but it's notenoughto make it all okay

You can't play onbrokenstrings
You can't feelanythingthat yourheartdon't want to feel
I can't tell yousomethingthat ain't real

Well thetruthhurts,
And lies worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you alittleless than before

But we'rerunningthrough the fire
When there'snothingleft to save
It's likechasingthe very last train
When we both know it's too late (too late)

You can't play onbrokenstrings
You can't feelanythingthat yourheartdon't want to feel
I can't tell yousomethingthat ain't real

Welltruthhurts,
And lies worse
How can I give anymore
When I love you alittleless than before
Oh you know that I love you alittleless than before

Let me hold you for the last time
It's the lastchanceto feel again

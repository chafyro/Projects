Happinesscomeswith success
And that Iguessis true
Butsuccessis more or less
Apointof view

I'm no millionaire
But I'm not the type to care
'Cause I've got apocketfulof dreams
It's my universe

Even with anemptypurse
'Cause I've got apocketfulof dreams
I wouldn't take thewealthof Wall Street
For a roadwherenature trods

And Icalculatethat I'mworthmy weight
In goldenrods
Lucky,luckyme
I can live in luxury
'Cause I've got apocketfulof dreams

Dogs werewhistlinga new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping itwouldcome soon so that theycoulddie

Honestly what willbecomeof me
I don't like reality
It's way tooclearto me
Butreallylife is daily
We are what we don't see
We misseverythingdaydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all goodthingscome to an end

Traveling Ialwaysstop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way Istressless
I want to pull away when thedreamdies
The pain sets it and I don't cry
I only feelgravityand Iwonderwhy

And the sun waswonderingIf itshouldstay away for a day 
Until thefeelingwent away 
And thecloudsweredroppingAnd the rainforgothow tobringsalvation

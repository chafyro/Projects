Every time I turn around
You say that you're notcheckingfor love in that way
Buteverytime I comearoundyou seem

Lights, camera, action; show what we'reabout'cause it's
Show time; our love'sbreakingout

Soafraidof whatpeoplemight say
But can't you see it's a game they play
Trying to cast ashadowon our love

Wanna kiss you when I wanna, baby

Because it's not fair to love you in chains

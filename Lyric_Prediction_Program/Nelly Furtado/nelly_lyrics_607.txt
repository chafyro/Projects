All I know iseverythingis not as it's sold
But the more I grow, the less I know
And I havelivedso many lives,thoughI'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
Thefewerthe seeds, the more I sow

Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try, try

I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the realpeoplearereallynot real at all
The more I learn, the more I learn
The more I cry the more I cry
As I saygoodbyeto the way of life
IthoughtI haddesignedfor me

Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see youstandingthere
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is try, oh try, try, try

All of themomentsthatalreadypassed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of thethingswe want eachotherto be
Weneverwill be, weneverwill be

And that's wonderful, that's life
That's you baby, this is me baby
We are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are free in our love
We are free in our love
Try

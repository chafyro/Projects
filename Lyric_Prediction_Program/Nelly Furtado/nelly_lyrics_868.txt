Youlikedme till youheardmy shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain'tgoingsolo
Youlikedme till youheardmy shit on the radio
But now I'm just toomainstreamfor you, oh no
Youlikedme till you seen me on your t.v.
Well if you're so lowbelowthen why you watching
You say goodthingscome tothosewho wait
Well I've beenwaitinga long time for it

[Chorus]
Irememberthe days when I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less then I was just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Andstillyoucursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

You say yourquestis tobringit higher
Well Ineverseenchangewithout a fire
But from yourmouthI have seen a lot of burning
ButunderneathIthinkit's a lot of yearning
Your face, thecolourschange fromgreento yellow
To thepointwhere you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'dexpectfrom me, like that's what I'm about

[Chorus]

It's so mucheasierto stay downthereguaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up hereexposingmyselftryingtobreakthrough
Than to burn in the spotlight,(open fire) turn in the spitfire(open fire)
Screamwithoutmaking a sound, be up herewithoutlookin' down
Because we're allafraidof heights

[Chorus]

Now you feelin' me now you feelin' me now you feelin' me 
Now you feelin' me now, now you feelin' me now you feelin'
Why ya hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me so so,
Leave me down down down down lowleaveme down da down down da down da down down down

Pictureperfecta life that you saw in a magazine
Ormaybeatravelingbook
Wanted to get on thatplaneand fly away
cause you are a rock star deep down inside
You walk with a swagger, got nothin' to hide 
Cigarette in your mouth, a cuff on your jeans
Yoursideburnsare perfect, you're aperfectand lean
So you made an oilpaintingto immortalize
All of the hope andvisionin your eyes
In yourleisurecoat andcowboyhat
NorthAmericanrecords and so much to bat for

Pleasebringme along
Pleasebringme along
Because I want to seeeverythingyou have toofferme

Get a jobliftingcement
Oh it's so dry when itrainsit gets wet
And thevillagewas great, now it's a suburb
You leftbehindhalf of all that you had learnt
Relearn acouplethingsalongthe way
Thethriftshop socleanall for half what you'd pay
So you tryeverythingon, on for size
Drop top yourCamaroand go for a ride

Pleasebringme along
Pleasebringme along
Because I want to seeeverythingyou have toofferme

And I don't mind to sit here andwastemy time
Oh but thisworldis not mine to define
And I want to shine

Pleasebringme along
Please take me away
I don't want to stay

And I want to seeeverythingyou have toofferme
And I want to seeeverythingyou have toofferme

I left myheartin SanFranciscoWith some club kids on acrowdedstreetsomewhereThe sky was red and he said, 
"Would you like to come be a part of myNorthAmerican Dream?"
Icouldtry tochaselife down, down thestreetand I'd find theseparationOf fact and fiction

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if IbudgeI just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if IbudgeI just might

I left myconsciencesomewhere with my rhythm
Iheardabout it from themouthof a man
He washoppingsometrainsandcombingthe land
Looking for alover(kiss)plantedin the east
Trying to run from thedreadedfist beast
And it lies, it lies in thepicketfence call
It was my ownparadisewith my ownprivatecorridor

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if IbudgeI just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if IbudgeI just might

So I'mdancingto a new beat and it came to me in bed
Myveinsbecame astrainoflightthat I let to flow instead
And a wish came to me likePeterPan at mywindowand said
Evolve yourdestinychild and you'llneverwalk alone-no
You'llneverwalk alone, but
Travel to the land ofsurrendertill' you can't cry no more
Till you can't, till you can't
And you'llneverwalk alone

You'll nev, you'll nev, you'llneverwalk alone, you'll nev, 
You'll nev, you'llneverwalk alone
Never walk,neverwalkalonealone, alone
All thisinspirationispassingme by
All I can do ischillwhen Ireallywanna fly
And thispollutiondonothingbutdirtyup my mind
Faster thanforeverin theblinkof an eye
To see past mylethargyis hard I feign
Thebeautyof myyouthis 
Gone but thechemicalsremain

I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if IbudgeI just might
I'm tryin' a find a way
I'm tryin' a find a right
And if IbudgeI just might

Itravelto this land ofsurrenderbut I see it's all over me, over and over 
Again and I try and I try and I try anangelon my left side and adevilOn myrightand theyfightand theyfightand theyfightthey're fighting, 
They're fighting, they'refightingfor my attention...hello?

Pleaseforgivethis platitude
But I like your attitude
You are just the kind I've had in mind
Nevercouldfind

Honey, I'm so keen on you
Icouldcome to lean on you
On arandombay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see thesunnyside
Eventroublehas it'sfunnyside
When you're gone, mysugarcandy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone
What can I do?

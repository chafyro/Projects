Pick youapartat the seams
Drown you out if I don’t want to hear you
Crusheverysingle one of your dreams

I’mgoingunder thewaterit’spullingme down
I can’t help myself

I’m my ownworstenemy, enemy, enemy
It’ll be the end of me, end of me, end of me

Iwantedto go the distance
I meteverythingwith resistance
Ipulledthe pin out on the grenade
Burned downeverythingI had made

As Istrugglein here I seeangelsnear
Can’t help myself

I’m my ownworstenemy, enemy, enemy
It’ll be the end of me, end of me, end of me
And thecoastisclearon me,clearon me,clearon me
I’m my ownworstenemy, enemy
I’m an open field

I put on my armour
Strap on my boots
Lookaroundto seewhichweapons I’ll choose
I’mgoingfor medals, decoration

So I’ll call you if I need help
I’ll call you if I need help
I’ll call you if I need help

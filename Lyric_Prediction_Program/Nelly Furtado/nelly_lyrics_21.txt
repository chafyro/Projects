Yourcollarpops in thelateststyle
I feelromancehanging in your smile
Is it just me or theParissun?
On this boulevard,makingeverything so ooh la la
Hyper colour,hyperrain
Elevatingeverysinglethingthat I feel
Like a 70's photograph,makingme smile
Making me feel so alive

We can't stayforeverthis way
So howaboutwe run away
Toanotherlifetime
Where I can beyoursand you mine

Language of love on your lips like a song
Heavy elixir, youcoulddo no wrong
Is it just me or theParissun?
Scorching the boulevard,makingyou look so ooh la la

We can't stayforeverthis way
So howaboutwe run away
Toanotherlifetime
Where I can beyoursand you mine
I can be yours
I can be yours
I can be yours

We can't stayforeverthis way
So howaboutwe run away
Toanotherlifetime
Where I can beyoursand you mine
And you mine
And you mine
And you mine
And you mine

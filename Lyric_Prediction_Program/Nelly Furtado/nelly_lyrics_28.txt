Mother
Just lay your head down
You beenburningboth ends of the candle
And you're done
It's time to find yourwingsagain
And turn your facetowardsthe sun
Somebattlescan't be won

Like a phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix
Rising from the flame

You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabealrightagain

Oh, brother
Yourhandsare tired
You've beenholdingtheworldup
And you'relosingyour grip
If you knew now what you knew then
Maybe you'd bewholeagain
Buteveryonefalls down

Like a phoenix
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix
Rising from the flame

You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabealrightagain

Youbuildacastlein the clouds
And then the fireburnedyou down
But you'restillstanding anyway
When all youneededfrom the start
Waswaitingthereinsideyourheartto be born again

Like a phoenix
Like a phoenix
You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabealrightagain
You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabe alright
You'regonnabealrightagain

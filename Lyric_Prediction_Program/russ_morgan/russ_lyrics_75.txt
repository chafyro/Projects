He's up eachmorningbright andearlyTo wake up all the neighborhood
Tobringtoeveryboy andgirlieHishappyserenade on wood
Hear him pickin' out a melody
Peck, peck, peckin' at the same old tree
He's ashappyas a bumblebee
All day long

Just find a tree that's shady
And when you hear that 
Tick-a tick tick  tick-a tick tick
Tick-a tick tick singrightalong
Come on and try his rhythm
And let yourheartsbeat with 'im
Justlistento that 
Tick-a tick tick tick-a tick tick

Here I go again
With my head in my hands
When you say you’ll call but you don’t
And then I’ll pretend
This is the last time
That I’ll take you back when you say you’re sorry

Don’tleaveme no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don’t know if you’regonnacome backaroundhere anymore
Don’tleaveme no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don’t know if you’regonnacome back to me here anymore
Don’t leave
Don’t leave

I used to be a queen
But now I’m ashadowof me
Ideservemore but love is a chore
Andwantingyou has made me so weak

Don’tleaveme no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don’t know if you’regonnacome backaroundhere anymore
Don’tleaveme no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don’t know if you’regonnacome back to me here anymore
Don’t leave
Don’t leave

I’m such a fool for you
And you keepplayingandplayingaround
Until the suncomesdown andrisesagain in the morning
And myheartkeepsbreakingand breaking
And I’mtiredofwastingandwastingaway for a cure

Don’tleaveme no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don’t know if you’regonnacome backaroundhere anymore
Don’tleaveme no more
Every time you walk out the door
I don’t know if you’regonnacome back to me here anymore
Don’t leave
Don’t leave

Myheartkeepsbreakingandbreakingandbreakingdown
You keepplayingandplayingandplayingaround

Each time t'would miss, we'dsteala kiss
And the merry-go-round went

Um-pah! Um-pah! Um-pah-pah-pah!'
Oh, the merry-go-roundbrokedown
And it made thedarnedestsound
Thelightswent low, we both said "Oh!"
And the merry-go-round went
"Um-pah-pah, um-pah-pah
Um-pah! Um-pah! Um-pah-pah-pah!'
Oh what fun - awonderfultime
Finding love for only a dime
Oh, the merry-go-roundbrokedown
But you don't see me frown

'Cause the the merry-go-round went
"Um-pah-pah, um-pah-pah
Um-pah! Um-pah! Um-pah-pah-pah!"

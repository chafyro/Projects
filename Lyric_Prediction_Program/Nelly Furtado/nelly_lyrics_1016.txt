I've seen a man cry, I've seen a man die inside
I've seen him say to me that he is only mine
That hegottado what is best for him
Never let me in, not even begin
To tell me I'm the oneunderhis moon and sun
That I am thethingthatrevolvesaround him
Butwhileon top of him I know what's best for him
I'll show him how to win and let me in because

I don't want to be your baby girl
I don't want to be yourlittlepearl
I just want to be what's best for me
To be one-da-dumb with my own starundermy own sun

We're allsorrynow
I didn't mean to wow
Make you cry like that
It's just alittlespat
Still I want you to know
Though I love you so
It'smostlyme dreaming, forcing, believing
That you're an ideal
Hell Ineversteal
But Istoleyou from
Fromanotherone
So takeyourselfand wraparoundmylittlefinger
'cause that's how itshouldswing

I don't want to be your baby girl
I don't want to be yourlittlepearl
I just want to be what's best for me
To be one-da-dumb with my own starundermy own sun

Why can't he see, why can't he see what'sinsideof me, yeah...
Don't you, don't you call me coochie-coo alittlegirl now...
Don't you gaga goo no coochie-coo girl now I'm so much more, can't you see? Can't you see?

Butterfliesreturnsomeday 

I don't want to be your baby girl
I don't want to be yourlittlepearl
I just want to be what's best for me
To be one-da-dumb with my own starundermy own sun

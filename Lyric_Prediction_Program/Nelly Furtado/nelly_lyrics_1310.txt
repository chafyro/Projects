Traveling, I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay (stay)
Young and restless
Living this way, Istressless
I want to pull away when thedreamdies
The pain sets in, and I don't cry
I only feel gravity, and Iwonderwhy

Well, the dogs werebarkingat the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping itwouldcome soon
And the sun waswonderingif it should
Stay away for a day
Till thefeelingwent away
And the sky was falling
And thecloudswere dropping
And the rainforgothow tobringsalvation
The dogs werebarkingat the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping itwouldcome soon
So that theycoulddie

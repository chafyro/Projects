All I know 
Iseverythingis not as it seems
But the more I grow the less I know
And I havelivedso many lives
Though I'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
Thefewertheseedsthe more I sow

Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Try

I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people, arereallynot real at all
The more I learn, the more I learned
The more I cry the more I cried
As I saygoodbyeto the way of life
IthoughtI haddesignedfor me

Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see youstandingthere
I'm all I'll ever be
And all I can do is try,
Try
 
All of themomentsthatalreadypassedalreadypassed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of thethingswe want eachotherto be

Weneverwill be, weneverwill be
And that's wonderful, that's life
That's you baby
This is me baby 
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Free
In our love 
We are free in our love

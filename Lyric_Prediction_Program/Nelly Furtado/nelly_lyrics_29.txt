Adolescent dreams
Runnin' instridewith me
Reason for misbehavin'
Indulgin' all my cravings
Makin' time for daydreamin'
Andneverreally seein'
I sitaroundjust teemin'
Everything losin' meanin'

Is this the meanin' of bein' free?
When the only one on thisislandis me
Is this our one true destiny?
Everywhere I look on the sea
Areislandsof me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me

Thecustomof mycountryis tonevergrow up
Run away fromeverything'til I getbetterluck
WhyshouldI have to look andnevertouch
What Iwannatouch, what Iwannatouch, what Iwannatouch

Is this the meanin' of bein' free?
When the only one on thisislandis me
Is this what we aremeantto be?
Everywhere I look on the sea
Areislandsof me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me

Adolescentdreamsbreakin' out of me
But the sun is comin' and theworldinfrontof me
Kool-aid I drink, pour it on the street
Inmemoryof my melancholy

Is this the meanin' of bein' free?
When the only one on thisislandis me
Is this our one true destiny?
Everywhere I look all I see
Areislandsof me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me
Islands of me, me, me

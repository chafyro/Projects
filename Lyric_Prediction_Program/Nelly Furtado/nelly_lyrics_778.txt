All I know
Iseverythingis not as it's sold
But the more I grow the less I know
And I havelivedso many lives
Though I'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
Thefewertheseedsthe more I sow

Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try, try

I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the realpeoplearereallynot real at all
The more Ilearnthe more I learn
The more I cry the more I cry
As I saygoodbyeto the way of life
IthoughtI haddesignedfor me

Then I see youstandingthere
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see youstandingthere
I'm all I'll ever be
But all I can do is try
Oh, try, try

All of themomentsthatalreadypassed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of thethingswe want eachotherto be
Weneverwill be, weneverwill be
And that's wonderful, and that's life
And that's you, baby
This is me, baby
And we are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are
Free
In our love
We are free in our love

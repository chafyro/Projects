I'mtalkingto themirroragain but it's not listening
I'mcleaningmydirtymind like atoiletbut it won't give in
I'mdrinkingspirits in thehopesthat I will findmyselfone
But all I canrectifyis that the party's just begun

[Chorus:]
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

I feel likefallingasleep andneverwaking up
It's not that myglassisemptybut I needanothercup
When all of thedoorsaround me just shut one by one
I feel likefallingasleep but the party's just begun

[Chorus]
Shakyshakysteps in themiddleof the day
A fire in my path and a cool decay
Oflimbsandtoothunder my skin
Oh, freedom,wheredo I begin
I'mchangingmyinflectionand how I say the words
Maybe it willsoundlikesomethingthey'veneverheard
Oh,deathof the party
Ipickedup thechaliceof malice
Anddranktill I was full, Idranktill I was full
I wasthirstybut Idranktill I was full, 
Idranktill I, till I,till I was full

There's afeverin mybonesthat I know so well
I keep my head low low low toavoidthe swell
But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell
Before they put me in that chamber
So I'mcleaningup as fast as I can
I'mcleaningup as fast as I can
'cause you can'tunbreakwhat you break, you can'tunfakethe very fake
Youcannotfuelwithouta tank, 
no you can'tunbreakwhat you break, what you break

[Chorus x 2]

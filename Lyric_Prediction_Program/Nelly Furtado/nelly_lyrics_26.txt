Tap dancing,fallingover my own two feet
Hoping that you like what you see
In the skies

I'm tap dancing,makingup themovesas I go along
Forgetting all thewordsto my song
Until I cry

Justdoingwhat I can
For you to like me
Hiding theclownI am
Deep downinsideme

Don't look too closely, just clap your hands
Don't say you know me, just cue the band
Let me tapdancefor you
Let me tapdancefor you

Tap dancing
Over all themarkson the floor
Pretending that Imightbesomethingmore than a smile
I'm tap dancing
Maybe I'maskingfor too much
Maybe Ishouldjust give it up for a while

And let thecurtainfall
And face the ugly
I shouldn't have todanceat all
For you to love me

Don't look too closely, just clap your hands
Don't say you know me, just cue the band
And let me tapdancefor you
Let me tapdancefor you

Ireallywanna take offtheseshoes
But I'mafraidof the truth
That I'm notenoughfor you

Don't look too closely
Just understand
No need tojudgeme
Just be a fan
Let me tapdancefor you
Let me tapdancefor you

I'mgonnatapdancefor you
Tap dance
For you

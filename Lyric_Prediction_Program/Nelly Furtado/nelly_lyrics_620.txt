You got your ways and I've got mine
It'stakingup all of my time
Waiting for you toadoreme
Come sit anddrinkfrom a cup
Don'tleaveuntil you're full up
You'retiredof all of your travelling

I don't neednothingat all
Nothing but your kiss
Nothing but your arms
I don't neednothingat all

Butsomebodyto love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love

I know I'mmissingfor a word
I'm nottryingto say a thing
I'mtryingto live in this moment
Count all the sins, what it says
Tell me how long it'll take
Tounravelyour body

I don't neednothingat all
Nothing but your touch
Nothing but your hand
I don't neednothingat all

Butsomebodyto love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love

I needsomebodyto love
Somebody to hold
Somebody that I can feel in my blood
Somebody to hold
Somebody to own
Somebody to make me feel I'm in love

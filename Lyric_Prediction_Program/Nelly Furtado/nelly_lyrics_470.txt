All you need is some self-reliance
'Cause thisworldisgonnaalways try us
And all youwantedwas to run for cover
Well hereÂ´slookingtoyourselfand no other
WeÂ´re allsearchingfor thatspecialsomething
And we keep on running

We all have thechoiceto take the lead or follow
I want to feel thelightshine on me

But thatÂ´s okay 'cause youÂ´re only human
YouÂ´re soafraidof whatpeoplemight say
But thatÂ´s okay youÂ´ll soon getstrongenough
YouÂ´re soafraidof whatpeoplemight say
But thatÂ´s okay cuz youÂ´re only human
YouÂ´re soafraidof whatpeoplemight say

But thelightitalwaysguides us

Itcouldtake alittletime
But Ithinkwe'll get it right
If this life is only
Only real life when it hurts
But Ithinkthat we'll survive
Survive

Imaginingeverythingwe want but can't have
Real life ain't so fantastic
But you and me wecouldhave had everything
And now that this dream'spalacesare deceiving
Wecouldhave it allwithoutthepricethat we paid
Wecouldhave it allwithoutthe chains

Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love
Into love, let's
Break free from the chains
Break free from the chains
Into love

Itcouldtake a little

But this lifecouldbe so blessed
If we keep it simple
Say no to the madness
And take care of the rest, the rest

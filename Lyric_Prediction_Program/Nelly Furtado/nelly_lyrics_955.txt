Youlikedme til youheardmy shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain'tgoingsolo
Youlikedme til youheardmy shit on the radio
But now I'm just toomainstreamfor you
Youlikedme til you seen me on your TV
Well if you're so lowbelowthen why you watching
You say goodthingscome tothosewho wait
I've beenwaitinga long time for it

Irememberthe days 
When I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less than I was 
Just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway 
I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Andstillyoucursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

You say yourquestis tobringit higher
Well Ineverseenchangewithout a fire
But from yourmouthI have seen a lot of burning
ButunderneathIthinkit's a lot of yearning
Your face, thecolorschange fromgreento yellow
To thepointwhere you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what youexpectfrom me, like that's what I'm about

Irememberthe days 
When I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less than I was 
Just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway

Andstillyoucursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

It's so mucheasierto stay downthereguaranteeing you're cool
Than sit up hereexposingmyselftryingtobreakthrough
Than to burn in the spotlight, turn in the spitfire,
Screamwithoutmaking a sound, be up herewithoutlooking down
Because we're allafraidof heights

Irememberthe days 
When I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less than I was

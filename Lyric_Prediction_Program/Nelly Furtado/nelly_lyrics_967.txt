Oh, it's sobeautifulout and I can't see why we're not allowed
To be up in the sky with thebirdscounting the flowers
And oh, mypowershavefailedme again
When I can't seebeginningto end
Know I try to test itagainthrough the hours

Could not be born 'cause of you

Oh, why can't I begreenas thegrassbeneath my feet
Asfreshas the dew hits thegroundin the morning
And notyellowlikebumblebees
Please, take me off my knees, mykneesI don'twannabe red forever

I've been, I've been looking
I've beenlookingat the moon but I've beenthinkingof myself
I've got meundermy own skin, I don't neednobodyelse

If Icouldhave sunlight
In the palm of your hand

Oh theweatheroutside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Andsincewe've noplaceto go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't showsignsof stopping
And I'veboughtsome corn for popping
Thelightsareturnedway down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When wefinallykiss goodnight
How I'll hategoingout in the storm!
But if you'llreallyhold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire isslowlydying
And, my dear, we'restillgoodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

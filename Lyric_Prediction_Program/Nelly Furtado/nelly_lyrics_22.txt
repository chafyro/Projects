Shot down by your bullets
Theyshattermy face and my bones
If youlistento words, it hurts
Theycreeprightundermy skin, they cut so deep

Can't youunderstandI don't want battles, battles, battles?
And if you lay them in my hand, I won'tfightbattles, battles, battles
Tell me why we work so hard tobreakthese bones
Can we try to lay downthesesticks and stones?
Sticks and stones

Wecrashand fall together, so sad
We don't remember
While we'retearingus apart
But I can feel the cracks, thecracksin my heart

Can't youunderstandI don't want battles, battles, battles?
And if you lay them in my hand, I won'tfightbattles, battles, battles
Tell me why we work so hard tobreakthese bones
Can we try to lay downthesesticks and stones?
Sticks and stones

Why does it have to be so hard to surrender?
Well, we gotnothingleft,nothingleft to lose, lose

Can't youunderstandI don't want battles, battles, battles?
And if lay them in my hand, I won'tfightbattles, battles, battles
Tell me why we work so hard tobreakthese bones
Can we try to lay downthesesticks and stones?
Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones

There goes that song again, we use to call our serenade
We fell in love when weheardit played
Over and over, and over, over again
Istillremember when
I sang thewordsand they made you mine
I'dsteala kiss andrepeateach line
Over and over, and over, over and then
Wedriftedapart, youwalkedoff with my heart

It'sfunnyhow one listens,
Juststartsme reminiscing
I'd soonforgetthat when, I told myself
When you said, "So long", but I was wrong
There goes that song again

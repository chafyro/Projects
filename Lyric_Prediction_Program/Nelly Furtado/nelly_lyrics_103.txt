Baby I know you're outside
In here it's warm and dry
Gotfeelingsthat I've got to try expressing
Like alanguagethat Isharewith you
Let's talk in thespecialway we do
Don't want to beanywhereelse but here with you
Feels so good

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, helpmyselfat all
I can't hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, helpmyselffrom falling
So I'mwaitingfor the night

Baby I know it's late
We've gotdecisionsto make
Think of what wecouldcreate together
And with you I amneverafraid
To play with thehigheststakes
Nobodycouldbreak my rapture

Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, helpmyselfat all
I can't hold back
Day and night, day and night
You blow my mind, blow my mind
And I can't help, helpmyselffrom falling
So I'mwaitingfor the night

It's when I've got you on my mind, mind, mind
Cuz you're thetwinklein my eye, eye, eye
I've got to get you in my life, life, life

Talking to themirroragain, but it's not listening
Cleaning mydirtymind like a toilet, but it won't give in
Drinkingspiritsin thehopesthat I will findmyselfone
All I canrectifyis that the party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

I feel likefallingasleep andneverwaking up
It's not that myglassis empty, but I needanothercup
When all of thedoorsaround me just shut one by one by one
I feel likefallingasleep, but the party's just begun

Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun
Party's just begun

Begun, begun, begun

Shaky,shakysteps in themiddleof the day
A fire in my path and a cool decay
Oflimbsandtoothunder my skin
Oh, freedom,wheredo I begin?
I'mchangingmyinflectionand how I say the words
Maybe it willsoundlikesomethingthey'veneverheard
Oh,deathof the party
Ipickedup thechaliceof malice
Anddrank'til I was full, Idrank'til I was full
I was thirsty, but Idrank'til I was full
Idrank'til I, 'til I, 'til I was full

There's afeverin mybonesthat I know so well
I keep my head low, low, low toavoidthe swell
But it'll be cold in hell, it'll be cold in hell
Before they put me in that chamber
So I'mcleaningup as fast as I can
I'mcleaningup as fast as I can
'Cause you can'tunbreakwhat you break, you can'tunfakethe very fake
Youcannotfuelwithouta tank
No, you can'tunbreakwhat you break, what you break

You'rebeautifuland that's for sure
Yourneverever fade
Your lovely, but it's not for sure
And i won't ever change

And all my love is grey
And all my love is true

I'm like a bird 
I only fly away
I don't knowwheremy soul is
I don't knowwheremy home is
(And baby all I need for you to know is) (x2)

Yourfaithin mebringsme to tears
Evenafteralltheseyears
And itpainsme so much to tell
That you don't know me that well

and all my love is grey
and all my love is true

I'm like a bird
I only fly away
I don't knowwheremy soul is
I don't knowwheremy home is
(And baby all I need for you to know is)(x2)

It's not that I want to say good-bye
It's just that evey time you try to 
Tell me, me that you love me (oh)
Each andeverysingle day 
I know that I'll have toeventuallygive you away

And all my love is grey
And all my love is true (yeah)
And i'm just scared
That we may fall through

I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't knowwheremy soul is
I don't knowwheremy home is
(And baby all I need for you to know is)

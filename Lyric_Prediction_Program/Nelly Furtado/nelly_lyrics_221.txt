Oh oh, oh oh
Youlikedme 'til youheardmy shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain'tgoingsolo
Youlikedme 'til youheardmy shit on the radio
But now I'm just toomainstreamfor you, oh no

Youlikedme 'til you seen me on your TV
Well if you're so lowbelowthen why you watching
You say goodthingscome tothosewho wait
Well I've beenwaitinga long time for it

Irememberthe days
When I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less then I was 
Just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou

Now that I'veflownaway 
I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Andstillyoucursethe day 
Idecidedto stay true to myself

You say yourquestis tobringit higher
Well Ineverseenchangewithout a fire
But from your mouth, I have seen a lot of burning
ButunderneathIthinkit?s a lot of yearning

Your face, thecolorschange fromgreento yellow
To thepointwhere you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'dexpectfrom me, like that's what I'm about

It's so mucheasierto stay downthereGuaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up hereexposingmyself 
Trying tobreakthrough

Than to burn in the spotlight
Turn in the spitfire
Screamwithoutmaking a sound
Be up here and notlookingdown 
Because we?re allafraidof heights

Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself
Myself, myself, myself

Am Ithrowingyou off?
Nope!

Thefeelingthat you gave mereallydrives me crazy
You don't have aplayeron your trunk
I was at a loss of words
First time that we spoke

If yourlookingfor a girl that'lltreatyou right
If youlookingfor her in the day time in the light
Youmightbe the type if I play mycardsright
I'll find out by the end of the night

Youexpectme to just let you hit it
But will youstillrespect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand

I'll be thefirsttoadmitit, I'mcuriousabout you, you seem so loose

Youwannaget in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'mtiredof running, let's walk for a minute

And it's you that I want

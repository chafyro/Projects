I'm on the run for my life
It'sseemsthateverythingthat you said was right
Has come undone, lost my sight
But have you everthoughtyou've done your best

When you wereunderthe gun, that's right
I know. I've seen thisplacebefore
But it'sneverbeen so fun
Never been so fun

I've been on the run, thisshadowweighs a ton
It'sstartingto makesenseto me
I can'treallymake you love me
No, no, you know I can'treallymake you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, myshadowweighs a ton
I know Ifoundtherecipefor me
But I can'treallymake you love me
No, no, you know I can'treallymake you love me, no, no

You know I'mhauntedon overseas
Haunted on each coast
Play them like Ebaneeza
I made them see the ghost

Back from thefuturedonned inJapanesekimonos
Eventhoughthestreetsshow love, try to see me grow
Ioftensee me floatin', but myshadowitweighsa ton
Call it baggage, I use it all to advantage

But I can't make you love me
This time it's on you
And you can't try to deny,thesewords when they're true
I'm on the run

I've been on the run, thisshadowweighs a ton
It'sstartingto makesenseto me
I can'treallymake you love me
No, no, you know I can'treallymake you love me, no, no

I've been on the run, myshadowweighs a ton
I know Ifoundtherecipefor me
But I can'treallymake you love me
No, no, you know I can'treallymake you love me

Oh no, ay yo, cud get to steppin'
Yourtongueis like a weapon
This is cappin' fromheavenand yet so are ye's

Since the age of seventeen
I've beentakingapart microphones
You've beentakingapart men you've blown
Withglowingskeleton bones

In the closet,animalsstrikecuriousposes
They feel the heatbetweenus
But you need a woman'sgloriousstyle ondiamondto fetus
Carry my penis, I'm like the man in the moon
When wekissedthen you soon on the run

I've been on the run, thisshadowweighs a ton

No, no, you know I can'treallymake you love me, no, no

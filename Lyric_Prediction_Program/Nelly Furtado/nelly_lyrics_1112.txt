[Chali 2na]
Yo, this is alessonin friendship
Thedepthsof a kinship
Whatwomenand menbeginwith, and then slip
My pen drips
As Iscribblemythoughtson thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if alastedfriendship's involved
But love tocrossthe line
But that's why webuiltthese walls

[Chorus:NellyFurtado]
We beenfriendsfor a long time, a veryclosefriend of mine
Love you like you was mine, butrespecta thin line
I love you like you was mine,thinkabout you all the time
Veryclosefriend of mine, butrespecta thin line

[Akil]
Opposite's attract
When thefemaleand male come in contact
Stickysituationin fact
Trying not to let thefeelingscatch
But there's a thin linebetweenboth of y'all
So yourespectthat
Andentertainthe idea, but getbroughtback
To reality, andcouldyoureallylive with that?
Decision,basedon intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
Anongoingkinship, we waspeopletobeginwith
Disrespect was not intended
But yourfeelingssparked the sentence
Sometimes you're toointensein yourquestto invent
Theperfectman,pleaseunderstand, myrhymeis your repent

[Chorus: x2]

[Soup]
Man, too bad that webecamefriends first
I'm not onexperton howrelationshipsshould work
But, (echos) from theminuteit as known
Itchangedthewholetone on how wespokeon the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I wasstuckwhen your momswouldpick it up
Over you, all mybuddieswould swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you'restilloff limits
Nomatterall thetimesthat Ihinted(Yo, what youdoingafter this?)
Infatuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, Ishouldspill all my guts
Orwritea letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want, just, a touch

[Chorus: x2]

[Nelly Furtado]
I can't do this anymore
See myheartjustspillsout when you walk in the door
Friendshipturnsinto lust and this only tip
That I can'tcomprehendeven if I knew it
Can't dojusticetothesethings that I'm feeling
You gotsomeoneelse, don't want to becaughtstealing
Hell if she knew shewouldneverleaveus alone
In the room

[Chali 2na]
This was alessonin friendship
Istressin this sentence
Shouldwomenand men befriendsfirst?
And then slip?
My pendripsas Iscribblemythoughtson thin strips
Of devotion

[Akil]
Opposites attract
And bestfriendsmake aperfectmatch
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't noturningback
Theminuteyou let him in it and he hit that
That's that

[Marc 7]
We waspeopletobeginwith, but you was too relentless
Jeopardizing kinship,respectis intended
Resolve is my intent
While we got it in
I'mtryingtosalvagea friendship

[Chorus: x2]

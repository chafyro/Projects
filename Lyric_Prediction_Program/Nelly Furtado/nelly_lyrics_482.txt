Is it going, is it going, is it going, is it going?
I don't know what you'relookingfor

[Nelly]
I'm the type of girl that'll look you dead in the eye (eye)
I'm real as they come if you don't know why I'm fly
Seen ya try toswitchit up, but, girl, you ain't got to
I'm the Wonderwoman; let me go get my ropes
I'm a supermodel, and, mummy, si mummy
AmnestyInternationalgotbankrupt(I'm on top, on lock)
You love my ass, and my abs, and thevideocalled Promiscuous
Mystyleis meticulous

[Chorus]
If you see us in the club, we'll beactingreal nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

[Timbaland]
WhenTimbois in the party,everybodyput uptheirhands
I get a half a mill for my beats, you get acouplegrand
Nevergonnasee the day that I ain't got theupperhand
I'mrespectedfrom Californ-i-a way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just thepianoman
Your songgonnatop the charts; Iheard'em; I'm not a fan
(Like I said before: you know what they say here)
Talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em they can't do it like I can

[Chorus]

[Justin Timberlake]
Could youspeakup and stop the mumbling?
I don'tthinkyou'regettingclear
Sitting on the top; it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV; just let meclearthe air
Wemissedyou on thechartslast week
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If sexyneverleft, then why'severybodyon my shit?
Don't hate on me justbecauseyou didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk theotherway
'Cause our run willneverbe over; not atleastuntil we say 

[Chorus x 3]

Ahh-ahh-ahh

Honestly what willbecomeof me, 
I don't like reality, 
It's way tooclearto me, 
Butreallylife is daily, 
We are what we don't see, 
Wemissedeverything daydreaming

Flames to dust,
Lovers to friends,
Why do all goodthingscome to an end?

Come to an end.

Traveling I,
Only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way is Istressthis
I want to
Pull away when thedreamdies
Pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feelgravityand Iwonderwhy

Flames to dust,
Lovers to friends,
Why do all goodthingscome to an end?

Come to an end.

Well the dogs were whistlin' a new tune
Barkin' at the new moon
Hoping itwouldcome soon
So that theycoulddie

Flames to dust,
Lovers to friends,
Why do all goodthingscome to an end?

Come to an end.

Well the dogs werebarkingat the new moon
Whistlin? a new tune
Hoping it will come soon

And the sun waswonderingIf it should
Stay away for a day
'Til thefeelingwent away

And the sky wasfallingAnd thecloudswere dropping
And the rainforgothow tobringsalvation

The dogs werebarkingat the moon and
Whistlin' a new tune
Hoping it will come soon

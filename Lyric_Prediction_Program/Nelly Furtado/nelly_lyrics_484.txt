I don't know what's playing
Deep in my emotions
I live socloseto the river
Mydreamssing in slow motion

I wait by the waterfront
That'swhereI'll be holding
Thesegoddamnfeelings I'm feeling
Ishallbe folding

I step onslipperysidewalks
I'mslowlymoving along
Throughsomberpaths in the alley
Myweaknessgets strong

In the day
In the night
Say it right
Say it all
Youeithergot it
Or you don't
Youeitherstand or you fall
When your will is broken
When itslipsfrom your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan

[Chorus]
Oh you don't meannothingat all to me
No you don't meannothingat all to me
But you got what ittakesto set me free
Oh youcouldmeaneverythingto me

I can't say that, I'm not lost and at fault
I can't say that, I don't love thelightand the dark
I can't say that, I don't know that I am alive
And all of what I feel Icouldshow
Youtonightyou tonight

[Chorus]

From my hands, Icouldgive you
Something that I made
From my mouth, Icouldsing youanotherbrick that I laid
From my body, Icouldshow you aplaceGod knows
Youshouldknow thespaceis holy
Do youreallywant to go?

I've got a flatline, I need avitalsign
I've got a flatline, flatline, flatline

Driving in theworstconditions
Head on with a full collision
Now I'm on the tar in pieces
Bodypartsare all around
Took offwithoutlooking back
You couldn't cut myheartsome slack
Tried topatchit up with my hands
I call for backup, this is bad
I'm breathing,barelybreathing
Mypulseisbarelybeating

I don't feelnothingat all
I don't feelnothingat all
Come on,resuscitateme
Why don't you come and save me?
I don't feelnothingat all
I don't feelnothingat all
Hold me, you can make it right
Come on, you can save my life

So make it with yourbattleaxe
Ineverreally had a chance
And now I'llneverbe the same
Igottarecuperate
I'llneverbe the same

I don't feelnothingat all
I don't feelnothingat all
Come on,resuscitateme
Why don't you come and save me?
I don't feelnothingat all
I don't feelnothingat all
Hold me, you can make it right
Come on, you can save my life

Breathing,barelybreathing

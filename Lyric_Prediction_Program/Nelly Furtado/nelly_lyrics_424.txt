Ilookedat your face
I saw that all the love had died
I saw that we hadforgottento take the time

I, I saw that you couldn't care lessaboutwhat you do
You couldn't care lessaboutthe lies
You couldn't find the time to cry

Now our love'sfloatingout the window
Our love'sfloatingout the back door
Our love'sfloatingup in the sky
In heaven,whereit began
Back in God's hands

You said that you had said all that you had to say
You say, 'baby, it's the end of the day.'

We gave a lot
But it wasn't enough
We got so tired
That we just gave up

Now our love'sfloatingout the window
Our love'sfloatingout the back door
Our love'sfloatingup in the sky
In heaven,whereit began
Back in God's hands, back in God's hands

We didn'trespectit
We went andneglectedit
We didn'tdeserveit
But Ineverexpected this

Our lovefloatedout the window
Our lovefloatedout the back door
Our lovefloatedup in the sky
To heaven, it's part of a plan
It's back in God's hands, back in God's hands

Oh, it didn't last, it's athingof the past (thing of the past)
No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had (just what we had)
Oh, I want it back, (I want it back) just what we had (just what we had)
I want it back, (and I want it back) oh, just what we had (just what we had)
No, we didn'tunderstandit (didn'tunderstandit)
Oh, just what we had (just what we had)

Somewhere there's music
Howfaintthe tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till itcomestrue
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It'swhereyou are
Thedarkestnightwouldshine
If youwouldcome to me soon
Until you will, howstillmy heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
Howfaintthe tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
Thedarkestnightwouldshine
If youwouldcome to me soon
Until you will, howstillmy heart
How high the moon

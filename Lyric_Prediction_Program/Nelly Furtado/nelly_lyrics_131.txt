Meet me in a dream
Meet me in a song
Or in a melody
Thatlaststoo long
But stop
Invading my thoughts

Meet me in a crowd
We won’t know if it’s real
Because we’re not allowed
To show how we feel
But stop
Invading my thoughts

I know you don’t mean to
And all myfrontingyou see through
But stop
Just stop
Invading my thoughts

Now that I amlyinghere withimperfectionrunningthroughmy veins
I take the time tobreatheit in, itlooksso goodwrittenon my face
I love just like an animal, likediggingharder as you pull
The way I love thefeelingof yourunningthrough my,runningthrough my veins

I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive

But I want you
I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive
Can'tbelieveit
Neverwouldhavethought'cause I don't want to
But I want you

Aglassofwateron asunnyday
The cold air as it hits our faces, I can't face it
InDecemberon thesidewalkas we talk
And I just fall out of myself
I just fall out of myself
I can't help it, 'cause

I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive
Getting what I need andneverwhat I want
'Cause I don't need you
But I want you
I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive
Getting what I need andneverwhat I want
'Cause I don't want to
But I want you

And I feel soaliveand I can't get back down on the ground
I feel soalivewhen I goafterwhat I want
And thisfeverisgoingwild and I'm notgonnasettle down
And I, and I want what I want

I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive
Getting what I need andneverwhat I want
'Cause I don't need you
But I want you
I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive
Getting what I need andneverwhat I want
'Cause I don't want to
But I want you

I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive
Getting what I need andneverwhat I want
'Cause I don't need you
But I want you
I don'twannalive, I don'twannalive
Getting what I need andneverwhat I want
'Cause I don't want to
But I want you
But I want you

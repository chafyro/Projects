Ilookedat your face I saw that all the love had died
I saw that we hadforgottento take the time
I, I saw that you couldn't care lessaboutwhat you do
You couldn't care lessaboutthe lies
You couldn't find the time to cry

Weforgotabout love
Weforgotabout faith
Weforgotabout trust
Weforgotabout us

Now our love'sfloatingout the window
Our love'sfloatingout the back door
Our love'sfloatingup in the sky in Heaven
Where itbeganback in God's hands

You said that you had said all that you had to say
You said, "Baby, it's the end of the day"
And we gave a lot but it wasn't enough
And we got sotiredthat we just gave up

Now our love'sfloatingout the window
Our love'sfloatingout the back door
Our love'sfloatingup in the sky in Heaven
Where itbeganback in God's hands, back in God's hands

We didn'trespectit
We went andneglectedit
We didn'tdeserveit
But Ineverexpected this

Our lovefloatedout the window
Our lovefloatedout the back door
Our lovefloatedup in the sky to Heaven
It's part of a plan, it's back in God's hands
Back in God's hands

Oh, it didn't last, it's athingof the past
No, we didn't understand, oh, just what we had
Oh, I want it back, just what we had
I want it back, oh, just what we had

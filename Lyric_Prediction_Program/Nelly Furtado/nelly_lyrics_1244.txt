Irememberwhen I lost my mind
There wassomethingsopleasantabout that face
Even youremotionshad an echo
In so much space

Mmm…

And when you're out there
Without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn'tbecauseI didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Mmm…

Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Probably

An I hope that you arehavingthe time of your life

Mmm…

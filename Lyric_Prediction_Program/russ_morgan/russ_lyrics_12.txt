Round her neck she wore ayellowribbon
She wore it in the winter
And themerrymonth of May
When Iaskedher: Why theyellowribbon?
She said: It's for myloverwho is far far away

Far away, far away, far away, far away
She said: It's for myloverwho is far far away
Far away, far away, far away, far away
She said: It's for myloverwho is far far away

When, at first, she met awinsomeJohnny
He wasn't sure herheartwas pure
Her eyes were far too bold
So,roundher neck
He tied ayellowribbon
He tied ayellowribbon
'Cause itmatchedher hair of gold

Hair of gold, hair of gold
He tied ayellowribbon
'Cause itmatchedher hair of gold
Hair of gold, hair of gold
He tied ayellowribbon
For her eyes were far too bold

If, perchance, you spy alovelymaiden

And by her side,therewalks with pride
AJohnnystrong and gay
Androundher neckthereis ayellowribbon

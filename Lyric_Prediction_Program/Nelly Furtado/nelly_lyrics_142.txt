Mama told me to stay away from them niggas
Mama told me she had a K for them niggas
Mama told me she go to pay for them niggas
But mygrandmothertold me that shewouldpray for them niggas
They justyoungblack andignorantlusting overmodelsand them Benjamins

Got the gametwisted(like what?) licorice
When I wasrockinglottosmovingpacks up on McDonalds
She waslookingfor me,pulledup in that old El Dorado
I wasrunningaround with Chase,chasingnewblackwheels
WhywouldI do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed
But I use thatstill'cause I won't do that deal
Screw themuzzleinpotatoesof that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing, my papasmokingsure and bluffin'
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat-tat my four fiveknockingon your window
She saidtherewould be days like this
Pharrell, drop the instrumental

Yes sir

[Chorus: x2]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
StillsomehowI know I'll end upwherewe all came from
(From my mama's womb)

Crack a Swisher,crackthefiftherHennessypouringlikeNiagaraFalls
Used towatchMagic, heshowedme how to ball
Mom'sworkinglate night, to get aplateright
Had someolderbrothers, all we did wassmokeand play-fight
Wish Icouldgo back to them days 'causestreetsdon't play right
Someniggashard,otherniggas was the Kid 'N' Play type
But that didn't stop me frompretendingI wasApollofrom Rocky
Working on my dip-game, nownobodywanna box me

Pick and choose,stickand move
So manydudesended up withsleepingbags on late-night news
But not my mama's son,goingaround the hood forservingcustomers
Sheyappingin my ear, but it'slouderthan the muffler
What I didn'tlistento, I wish I would'vetrustedher
Wish I had a shovel, bediggingboth of mybrothersup
Like, "Here hug em ma, one last time"
Put achainon both of them niggas, they get one last shine

[Chorus]

Put yourblockdown,recognizea king 'cause it's my town
Word to mymotheryou canthrowup your rock now
Got off the beef shit 'cause I ain'ttrynasee my mama in all-black
Right there,cryingover hard facts
Now shegottaturn in all her cars and get herhouseback
Never, shecarriedme for ninemonthsso she can have whatever
Clever, shetaughtme how toshootBerettas, told me that I'd be a king
So R.I.P. to Coretta, if you don'tunderstandthat
Thenreferto my letter,whileI sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so Isignedon the X like Malcolm
Ridingthroughthe hood, youhatingniggas like, "How come?"
ThatniggasGame got it,heardhesellingtalcum
Either way, playboy,checkit, this is the outcome
Youmightnot like it, but my mama psychic
Why youniggastwisted like the top of a sidekick?

[Chorus]

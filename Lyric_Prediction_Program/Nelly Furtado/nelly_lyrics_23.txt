Drunkdialedyouagainlast night
Don't know my left foot from my right
Don't evenrememberwhatpridefeels like
Blaming thesystemagain
Then I gothroughmy list of friends
And then there's me I'mtotallyblameless
I've beenwaitingon the same love
Waiting on the same love again
Waiting for you to say my name
Iwannahear it again, again

Why don't youthinkof me anymore?
Why don't youdreamof me anymore?
Look what life's done to you
You hear lies in everybody's truths
Have you justgrownup and had enough?
And you don'tbelieveinmagicanymore
Have you justgrownup andgivenup?

I keep onbendingall my lines
To fit into aplacethatfeelsnice
To do my work and then go home tonight
I put away all my red shoes
So that I wouldn't get the blues
Thinkingaboutthe time that I knew how to dance

Have you justgrownup and had enough?
And you don'tbelieveinmagicanymore
Have you justgrownup andgivenup?
And you don'tbelieveinmagicanymore
Why don't youthinkof me anymore?
Why don't youdreamof me anymore?
Look what life's done to you
Tomorrow'sstraightjacket's today'sstraightsuit

Have you justgrownup and had enough?
And you don'tbelieveinmagicanymore
Have you justgrownup andgivenup?
And you don'tbelieveinmagicanymore
Have you justgrownup andgivenup?
And you don'tbelieveinmagicanymore

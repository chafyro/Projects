Everybody’scomingout
Glittering andscreamingso loud
I just want to walk down your road
I just want todanceslow

Of all I've known
All I've seen
You’re the mostbeautifulthing

Everyone islookingfor it
Searchinguntilthey arehurtingfor it
Stoplookingin the mirror
We’ve got just what we came with

Of all I've known
All I've seen
You’re the mostbeautifulthing

And I want you to sing for us
I want you to sing for us
Need you to sing for us

Everything I knowfeelsalright
I won’tsearchno more tonight

Of all I've known
All I've seen
All I dream
You’re the mostbeautifulthing

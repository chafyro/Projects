Youlikedme till youheardmy shit on the radio
Well I hate to say but pop ain'tgoingsolo
Youlikedme till youheardmy shit on the radio
But now I'm just toomainstreamfor you, oh no

Youlikedme till you seen me on your TV
Well if you're so lowbelowthen why you watching
You say goodthingscome tothosewho wait
I've beenwaitinga long time for it

Irememberthe days when I was soeagertosatisfyyou
Be less then I was just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Still youcursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

You say yourquestis tobringit higher
Well Ineverseenchangewithout a fire
But from yourmouthI have seen a lot of burning
ButunderneathIthinkit's a lot of yearning

Your face, thecolorschange fromgreento yellow
To thepointwhere you can't even say hello
You tell me you'd kill me if I ever snob you out
Like that's what you'dexpectfrom me, like that's what I'm about

Irememberthe days when I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less then I was just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway I see you'vechosento staybehindme
Andstillyoucursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself

It's so mucheasierto stay downthereguaranteeing you're cool
Than to sit up hereexposingmyselftryingtobreakthrough
Than to burn in thespotlighthoping fine
Turn in thespitfirehoping fine,screamwithoutmakinga sound
(Hoping fine)
Be here andlookingdown
(Hoping fine)
Because we're allafraidof heights

Irememberthe days when I was soeagertosatisfyyou
And be less then I was just toproveIcouldwalkbesideyou
Now that I'veflownaway I see you'vechosento staybehindme
And now youcursethe day Idecidedto stay true to myself
Myself, myself, myself, myself, myself, myself

Leave me down, down, down, down low,leaveme down
Da down, down da down da down, down, down

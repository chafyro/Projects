Climb amountainswim thesevenseas
Get your body to look like Hercules
Jump out anairplanewith a parachute
Fly up and away on a hot air balloon

We don't knowwhereit all ends
Some say it'salmostoveralmostover
If this is it then baby why aren't I on your shoulder
On your shoulder

In this lifetime
I want you to be mine
'Cause I took a long look at mybucketlist
And I saw that at thebottomit said ourfirstkiss and
Whoa I'mrunningout of time
Whoa I'mrunningout of time

Get on yourbootsandvisittheNorthPole
Tryeverysportuntilyouscorea goal
Follow the path of a butterfly
Go toGroundZero and donothingbut cry

In this lifetime
I want you to be mine
'Cause I took a long look at mybucketlist
And I saw that at thebottomit said ourfirstkiss and
Whoa I'mrunningout of time
Whoa I'mrunningout of time

This is not a dare
Not sometrickof a daredevil
I'dtradein mywildestdreams
For your forever

In this lifetime
I want you to be mine
'Cause I took a long look at mybucketlist
And I saw that at thebottomit said ourfirstkiss and
'Cause I took a long look at mybucketlist
And I saw that at thebottomit said ourfirstkiss and
Whoa I'mrunningout of time
Whoa I'mrunningout of time
Whoa I'mrunningout of time

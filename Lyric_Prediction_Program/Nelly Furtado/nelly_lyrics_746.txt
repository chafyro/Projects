Man-eater
Make you work hard, make youspendhard, make you want all of her love 
She's a man-eater 
Make you buy cars make you cutcardsMake you fall real hard in love 
She's a man-eater 
Make you work hard make youspendhard, make you want all of her love 
She's a man-eater 
Make you buy cars make you cutcardsWish youneverever met her at all

And when shewalksshewalkswithpassionWhen shetalksshetalkslike she canhandleit 
When she asks forsomethingboy shemeansit 
Even if youneverever see it

Because she says she love you love you long time (c'mon!)

You wish youneverever met her at all...

She's a man-eater, a man-eater.

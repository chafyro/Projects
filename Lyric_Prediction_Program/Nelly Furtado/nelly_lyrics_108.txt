You’re on thewrongside
Looking at therightside
This is the last light
At the end of the day

You’re on a long flight
Taking your last bite
Of the good lifebeforeit goes away

Where’d you go, oh where’d you go my friends, my friends?
You said youwouldbetheretill the end, the end
Knock you down you get back up again, again
And when they runafteryou
You just run from them

Where are all the believers?
Where are they when you need em’?
Where are all of the healers?
Why’d they run away?
Where are all the believers?
Where are all of the healers?
Where are they when you need em to
Get down and pray?

This is therighttime
Baby to be mine
Andtastethe good life
Before it goes away

Knock me down I get back up again, again
And if they runafterme
I’ll just run from them

Where are all the believers?
Where are they when you need em’?
Where are all of the healers?
Why’d they run away?
Where are all the believers?
Where are all of the healers?
Where are they when you need em to
Get down and pray?

Where are all the believers?
Where are they when you need em’?
Where are all of the healers?
Why’d they run away?

There are so many stars
In the sky tonight.
Which one will I
Take in my hand?

There are so many ways
Icouldlive my life.
Which one will I
Make part of my plan?

There are so many spirits
In the airtonightTrying to pull me away.

You're a part of me.
You're ineverybreath that I breathe.
Andeverystepforwardthat I take
And then I take a step backwards
If I don't see your face?
You're a part of me.
You're ineverysong that I sing
Andeverybird thatsingsto me.
And this is what Idreamto be real.
This is my reality.

There are so many songs
In the people's faces.
Everyonecouldbe yours
But they're not.

And all this lost
If I can't be true
To my own heart.

You're a part of me.
You're ineverybreath that I breathe.
Andeverystepforwardthat I take
And then I take a step backwards
When I can't see your face?
You're a part of me.
You're ineverysong that I sing
Andeverybird thatsingsto me.
And this is what Idreamto be real.
This is my reality.

Because myheartis alonelyhunter 
Dying tostrikeout.
Grabbed you into my world
When you didn't even ask,
But youalwaysknew 
That you had a past.

You're a part of me.
You're ineverybreath that I breathe.
Andeverystepforwardthat I take
And then I take a step backwards
When I don't see your face?
You're a part of me.
You're ineverysong that I sing
Andeveryword thatspeaksto me.
And this is what Ibelieveto be real.
This is my reality.

And I live in this sea.
There are so many stars
In the sky, tonight

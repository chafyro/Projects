Hey, man, don't look so scared.
You know I'm onlytestingyou out.
Hey man, don't look so angry,
You're realclosetofiguringme out.

We are a part of a circle.
It's like amobiusstrip,
And it goesroundandrounduntil itlosesa link.
And there's ashadowin the sky and itlookslike rain,
And shit isgonnafly once again.

Hey, man, we look at eachotherwithampleeyes,
So why not some time todiscoverwhat'sbehindyour eyes?
I've got so manyquestionsthat I want to ask you.
I am sotiredof mirrors- pour me aglassof your wine!

And there's ashadowin the sky and itlookslike rain,
And shit isgonnafly once again!
I've got abunchofgovernmentchecks at my door.
EachmorningI try to send them back but they only send me more.
I look atmyselfin the mirror; am Ivitaltoday?
Hey, man, I let myconscienceget in the way!

And there's ashadowin the sky , and itlookslike rain,
And shit isgonnafly once again,
And I don't mean to rain on your parade,
Butpathoshas got me once again
And I don't wantambivalenceno more,
I don't wantambivalenceno more,
I don't wantambivalenceno more,
No I don't wantambivalenceno more!

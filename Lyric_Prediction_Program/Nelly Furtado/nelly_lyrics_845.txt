I can'tbelieveyou need me
Ineverthought Iwouldbeneededfor anything
I can'tbelievemyshoulderswouldcarrysuchimportantweight
As your head and your tears
I can'tbelieveyouchoseme, in all my fragility, me
Ithurtsso much when i love you, itmakesme cry 
Every time

You, you are, oh you are
Thelittleboy made for me in the stars
In the stars, that's why I can't let you go
Thelittleboy made for me in the stars
That's why I love you more thefurtherI go
Andbeforethisexistenceyou werealwaysthere
Waiting for me
You are, you are therealestthing I know
Hands down
Therealestthing I know

I am not used tobeingcarried
Orbeingable tocarryaprettysong
I have beenbruisedby my many trails
Sometimes my skin's sothickit's frail
I just need to beignored'til I wake up to thebeautythat is yours
And it allcomesto life so, so suddenly
This is aplaceso deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause
All theenergyittakesto feel this power
I tend to run, I tend to hide, 'til I find you and I know I got you
I know, I know, I know

You're thelittleboy made for me in the stars
In the stars, that's why I can't let you go
Thelittleboy made for me in the stars
That's why I love you more thefurtherI go
Andbeforethisexistenceyou werealwayshere
Inside of me
You are, you are therealestthing I know
Hands down...therealestthing I know

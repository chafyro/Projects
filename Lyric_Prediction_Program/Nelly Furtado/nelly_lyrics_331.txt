Dogs werewhistlinga new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping itwouldcome soon so that theycoulddie

Honestly what willbecomeof me
I don´t like reality
It´s way tooclearto me
Butreallylife is daily
We are what we don´t see
Wemissedeverything daydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all goodthingscome to an end

Traveling Ialwaysstop at exits
Wondering if I´ll stay
Young and restless
Living this way Istressless
I want to pull away when thedreamdies
The pain sets it and I don´t cry
I only feelgravityand Iwonderwhy

And the sun waswonderingif itshouldstay away for a dayuntilthefeelingwent away
And thecloudsweredroppingand the...

I left myheartin SanFranciscowith some club kids
On acrowdedstreet somewhere
The sky was red and he said
"Would you like to come be a part of myNorthAmerican dream?"
Icouldtry tochaselife down
Down thestreetand I'd find
Theseparationof fact and fiction

I'mtrynnafind a way (trynna find a way)
I'mtrynnafind aright(trynna find a right)
And if IbudgeI just might
I'mtrynnafind a way (trynna find a way)
I'mtrynnafind aright(trynna find a right)
And if I budge, I just might

I left myconsciencesomewhere with my rhythm
Iheardabout it from themouthof a man
He washoppingsometrainsandcombingthe land
Looking for aloverplanted in the east
Tryna run from thedreadedfist beast, beast, beast

And it lies and lies
In thepicketfence call
It was my ownparadisewith
My ownprivatecorridor

I'mtrynnafind a way (trynna find a way)
I'mtrynnafind aright(trynna find a right)
And if IbudgeI just might
I'mtrynnafind a way (trynna find a way)
I'mtrynnafind aright(trynna find a right)
And if I budge, I just might

So I'mdancingto a new beat and it came to me in bed
Myveinsbecame astrainoflightthat I let to flow instead
And a wish came to me likePeterPan at mywindowand said
"Evolve your destiny, child, and you'llneverwalk alone, no
You'llneverwalk alone," but
Travel to the land of surrender
'Til you can't cry no more
'Til you can't, til you can't
And you'llneverwalk alone

All thisinspirationispassingme by
All I can do ischillwhen Ireallywanna fly
And thispollutiondonothingbutdirtyup my mind
Faster thanforeverin theblinkof an eye
To see past mylethargyis hard I feign
Thebeautyof myyouthis gone
But thechemicalsremain

I'mtrynnafind a way (trynna find a way)
I'mtrynnafind aright(trynna find a right)
And if I budge, I just might
I'mtrynnafind a way (Itravelto this land of surrender)
I'mtrynnafind aright(but I see it's all over me) 
And if IbudgeI justmight(over and overagainand I try and I try)
I'mtrynnafind a way (and I try, anangelon my left side)
I'mtrynnafind aright(and adevilon my right)
And if IbudgeI justmight(and theyfightand theyfightand they fight)

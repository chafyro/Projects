Oh, Icouldhide 'neath the wings
Of thebluebirdas she sings.
The six o'clockalarmwouldneverring.
But itringsand I rise,
Wipe thesleepout of my eyes.
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings.

Cheer up,sleepyJean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To adaydreambeliever
And ahomecomingqueen.

You oncethoughtof me
As awhiteknight on a steed.
Now you know howhappyI can be.
Oh, and our goodtimesstart and end
Withoutdollarone to spend.
But how much, baby, do wereallyneed.

Cheer up,sleepyJean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To adaydreambeliever
And ahomecomingqueen.
Cheer up,sleepyJean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To adaydreambeliever
And ahomecomingqueen.

Cheer up,sleepyJean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To adaydreambeliever
And ahomecomingqueen.

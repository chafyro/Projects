What they say, what they say, what they say
What they say, what they say, what they say

Youspeakout, all you feel is defiance
All you need is some self-reliance
'Cause thisworldisgonnaalways try us
And all youwantedwas to run for cover
Well, here'slookingtoyourselfand no other
We're allsearchingfor thatspecialsomething
And we keep on running

We all have thechoiceto take the lead or follow
I want to feel thelightshine on me

[Chorus]
You're soafraidof whatpeoplemight say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're soafraidof whatpeoplemight say
But that's okay, you'll soon getstrongenough
You're soafraidof whatpeoplemight say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
You're soafraidof whatpeoplemight say
You'regoingto break
Sopleasedon't do it

Youwannaspread your wings, but you're not sure
Don'twannaleave your comforts
Wanna find a cure
We'reafraidof who we see in the mirror
Wewannalet got but itfeelstoo pure
Whowantsto bealonein this world?
You lookaroundand all you see is hurt
But thelight- italwaysguides us
If we move with alittletrust

We all have thechoiceto take the lead or follow
I want to feel thelightshine on me

[Chorus]

Adiamonddon'tdefinewhatshineis
I don't need aRolexto know what the time is
You got yours; let me find what mine is
I'm a survivor; look howstrongmy mind is
Istandon my own; it's all me
Regardless ofwhateverthey call me

I'm a leader, not a follower
And I'dratherbe paid and popular
Ride, homey, get yourdollarsup
WeÂ´re in thebellyof thebeastthatalreadyswallowed us

It's the end of theworldas we know it
It's the end of theworldas we know it

[Chorus]

You'restandingat the door
I'mfallingto the floor
You look evenbetterthan you did before
I'mstaringat my feet
Wondering if I can do this
It's been awhilebut I couldn'tforgetyou

Just alittlelook has got mefeelingthings
Just alittletaste has got meseeingthings
Just alittletouch has got me off the chains
Doingthingsthat I don't want to

Do it like you do it to me (I'mburningup)
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
Don't you know how much I want you

We'resittingrealcloseand I can feel your breath
Iwannatouch your hand but I lay back
'cause you know thisthingcouldsprialin the night
I'vechangedmy mind I'mreadyfor you this time

We'resittingrealcloseI can feel your breath
Iwannatouch your hand but I lay back
We'resittingrealcloseI can feel your breath
Iwannatouch your hand Icannotfight it off

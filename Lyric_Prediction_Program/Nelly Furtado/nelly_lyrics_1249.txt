My lovegrowsdeepereveryday andtakesalittlepiece of me
My lovegrowsdeepereveryday, deep into the sea
Buttakesalittlepiece of me, alittlepiece of me

Oh, it's sobeautifulout and I can't see why we're notallowedto be
Up in the sky with the birds,countingthe flowers
And oh, mypowershavefailedmeagainwhen I can't seebeginningto end
Though I try and test itagainthrough the hours

Wanderingstarsin the bluecouldnot be born 'cause of you
Wanderingstarsin the bluecouldnot be born 'cause of you

My lovegrowsdeepereveryday andtakesalittlepiece of me
My lovegrowsdeepereveryday andtakesalittlepiece of me
Deepereveryday, deep into the sea
Alittlepiece of me, alittlepiece of me

Oh, why can't I begreenas thegrassbeneath my feet?
Asfreshas the dew hits thegroundin the morning
And notyellowlikebumblebees,pleasetake me off my knees
My knees, I don'twannabe red forever

Wanderingstormsin the bluecouldnot be born 'cause of you
Wanderingstormsin the bluecouldnot be born 'cause of you

I've been, I've been looking
I've beenlookingat the moon, but I've beenthinkingof myself
I've got meundermy own skin, I don't neednobodyelse
I'mlookingat the moon, but I'mthinkingof myself
I've got meundermy own skin, I don't neednobodyelse
